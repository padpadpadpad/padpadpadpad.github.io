      <description>Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m an ecologist studying how organisms adapt to change and how ecological processes scale from the very small (metabolism of a single cell) to the very big (ecosystem functions such as primary production).
I am interested in how and why communities coexist, and the feedbacks and indirect effects between ecological and evolutionary processes on species interactions within communities.
The aim of this blog This blog will hopefully serve as a platform for me to be me, mainly blogging about R and my research interests (and probably football).</description>
