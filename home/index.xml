      <description>A little about me I am an ecologist with broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. The common thread throughout my research so far has been the impacts of climate change on the biosphere, primarily on phytoplankton and bacteria. During my PhD with Gabriel Yvon-Durocher, I explored how warming will alter rates of photosynthesis and respiration in phytoplankton. To do this, I combined ideas from metabolic theory and experimental approaches from studying Icelandic streams to experimental evolution.</description>
