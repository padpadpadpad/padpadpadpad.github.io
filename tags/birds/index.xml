      <description>Me and Soph, my partner of 8 years, have never found particular enjoyment in the birds around us. Sure I loved seeing a robin, who doesn’t, and Soph has always loved ducks, but the other birds in the garden barely registered.
However, 2019 is the year we became garden bird aware. Unfortunately, 2019 is also the worst year of our lives. Soph’s health has deteriorated further. She is essentially bed bound with constant extreme, excrutiating, indescribale pain all over her body.</description>
