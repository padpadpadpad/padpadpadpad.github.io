Introduction For my first academic publication, a reviewer asked for the \(r^{2}\) values of the thermal performance curves I fitted using non-linear regression. I bowed to the request as is often the case with reviewer comments, but would now resist as the \(r^{2}\) is not necessarily an effective goodness of fit measure for non-linear regression (see this SO answer).</description>
